# Full Stack Todo App
This is a simple inerview question usually. This app is a great way to see judge someone's web development skills. I completed this app in under an hour and secured an internship. Hope this helps all of you out there.

## The tech stack
- Sqlite3 (The Data Base)
- React JS (Typescript)
- Express JS (Over Node JS)
- Node JS (JavaScript)

## How to set this app up
- clone the repository
- `cd front-end` into the folder and hit `npm install` then `npm run dev` to run the front-end part
- make visual changes to the front end as required (The front end will not be functional right now, you won't be able to test it just yet)
- Once done, hit `npm run build` in the console
- place the files and folder from the build folder into the public folder under back-end
- Hit `cd ../back-end` to go into the back-end folder
- Make changes to the server code as required, then hit `npm start` to see the development server
- `localhost:3000` is where you should be able to see the app running and fully functional
- You can debug any issued in the backend from here, although any changes in the front end will need to be done in `front-end` and then build and push code to the `back-end/public` folder.
